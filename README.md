# CandyCane
Email parser for zimbra and gmail archives written in python

## Setup
For webkit, on linux/Mac we need to install
 apt-get install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
otherwise html2 throws a "Not implemented: error.
This package should be installed before wxPython otherwise, should clear the python cache and force a long reinstall of wxPython.
On windows it does not matter as iexplorer should already be present.
Alternatively could use: wx.html.HtmlWindow instead of wx.html2.WebView.New

 pip3 install python-dateutil
 pip3 install wxPython

.... to be updated! list and formating
